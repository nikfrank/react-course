Let's get to the code already!

(this course assumes you have git, yarn, a text editor, and a command line available)

Let's make our work directory for the course

```
mkdir -p ~/code/react-course
cd ~/code/react-course
```

and clone the first workbook

```
git clone https://github.com/nikfrank/react-course-workbook-0
cd react-course-workbook-0
yarn
```

open up our text editor to ./src/App.js

```
emacs ./src/App.js
```

(this command will vary, most people will probably just open the file in the text editor)

and write our first line of code

before:
```js
  dealNextCard = ()=> 0 // noop
```

after:
```js
  dealNextCard = ()=> this.setState(({ cards, handStatus })=> ({
    cards: (handStatus === 'hitting') ?
           cards.concat( newCard() ) :
           [ newCard{}, newCard() ]
           
  }), ({
    hasAce = !!cards.find(({ rank })=> rank === 1),
    total = cards.reduce((p, { rank })=> p + Math.min(10, rank), 0),
    
  })=> this.setState(({ cards })=> ({
         handStatus: (total > 21) ? 'bust' :
                     (total >= 17) ? 'standing' :
                     (hasAce && (total === 11)) ? 'blackjack' :
                     (hasAce && (total >= 8) && (total < 11)) 'standing' :
                     'hitting'
       }) )
  )
```

that was a lot of fun!

now your app plays the dealer hand like a las vegas dealer, all in one line of code.

just do ```npm start``` in the project root and it'll run on localhost:3000 in your browser

---

The purpose of this admittedly silly example is to intruduce you to the main topics we'll be covering:

- react (here we use React.Component's this.setState function)
- functional style programming
- es6 (destructuring, fat arrows, default params used here)

also, it's important to understand javascript is a language of many styles, finding what works for you is the most important - this function is how I like to write things, but maybe isn't your cup of tea!

You'll read plenty of javascript, some of it will be good stuff - so keep your eyes open.
