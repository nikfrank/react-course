Let's get to the code already!

(this course assumes you have git, yarn, a text editor, and a command line available)

[workbook 0 - blackjack](https://github.com/nikfrank/react-course-workbook-0)

Let's make our work directory for the course

```
mkdir -p ~/code/react-course
cd ~/code/react-course
```

and clone the first workbook

```
git clone https://github.com/nikfrank/react-course-workbook-0
cd react-course-workbook-0
yarn
```

open up our text editor to ./src/App.js

```
emacs ./src/App.js
```

(this command will vary, most people will probably just open the file in the text editor)

and write our first line of code

before:
```js
  dealNextCard = ()=> 0 // noop
```

after:
```js
  dealNextCard = ()=> this.setState(({ cards, handStatus })=> ({
    cards: (handStatus === 'hitting') ?
           cards.concat( newCard() ) :
           [ newCard(), newCard() ]
           
  }), ({
    hasAce = !!this.state.cards.find(({ rank })=> rank === 1),
    total = this.state.cards.reduce((p, { rank })=> p + Math.min(10, rank), 0),
    
  } = {})=> this.setState(({ cards })=> ({
         handStatus: (total > 21) ? 'bust' :
                     (total >= 17) ? 'standing' :
                     (hasAce && (total === 11)) ? 'blackjack' :
                     (hasAce && (total >= 8) && (total < 11)) ? 'standing' :
                     'hitting'
       }) )
  )
```

that was a lot of fun!

now your app plays the dealer hand like a las vegas dealer, all in one line of code.

just do ```npm start``` in the project root and it'll run on localhost:3000 in your browser

The purpose of this admittedly silly example is to intruduce you to the main topics we'll be covering:

- react (here we use React.Component's this.setState function)
- functional style programming
- es6 (destructuring, fat arrows, default params used here)

also, it's important to understand javascript is a language of many styles, finding what works for you is most important - this function is how I like to write things, but maybe isn't your cup of tea!

You'll read plenty of javascript, some of it will be good stuff - so keep your eyes open.

the precocious student will want to learn how this works (instead of just typing it in and believing in magic):

**feel free to skip over this section the first time you go through this lesson!**

### First: calculate next cards

```js
  dealNextCard = ()=> this.setState(({ cards, handStatus })=> ({
    cards: (handStatus === 'hitting') ?
           cards.concat( newCard() ) :
           [ newCard(), newCard() ]

  }),
```

first, we are declaring an [instance method](https://medium.com/@charpeni/arrow-functions-in-class-properties-might-not-be-as-great-as-we-think-3b3551c440b1) ```this.dealNextCard``` which takes no params ```()=>```

the body of the function is one line (it doesn't start with a { and end with a }) and consists of a call to ```this.setState```

```this.setState``` is from the [React Component API](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate), in this case using the updater function **not** the shallow merge (which is the simpler way)

after destructuring the ```cards``` and ```handStatus``` out of ```this.state```, we return an object with a new value for ```this.state.cards```

the new value we calculate is determined by ```handStatus```:
- if we're hitting, our new cards array will be the old array with a ```newCard()``` concatenated (newCard is a function declared earlier in the file which generates an object with a random ```rank``` and ```suit``` property, each being just a number)
- if we're not hitting it is assumed the hand is over, so we return a two new cards


In total, the first chunk calculates the cards, either adding one new card or a new hand. After the comma ```}),``` we have finished our updater function as the first param, and are ready to pass the second param to ```this.setState``` (which is a callback function)


### Intermezzo: calculate the total and if there is an ace in the hand

```js
  ({
    hasAce = !!this.state.cards.find(({ rank })=> rank === 1),
    total = this.state.cards.reduce((p, { rank })=> p + Math.min(10, rank), 0),
    
  } = {})=>
```

Here, we're exploiting two facts to calculate the ```total``` and ```hasAce``` values without writing two lines of code:

1. React's ```this.setState```'s second param is a callback which receives no parameters (React calls it once the state update we're requesting is done)
2. We can set a default value for function params (here the {} near the end), which will always be used (as the function is called with ```undefined``` as the first param)... then we can destructure that empty object and set default values for fields of that object (which again, will always be used), and those default values are evaluated expressions - which since we are in the callback function, we know our state update has occured, and thus can use our new cards in our calculations.

**this is actually bad code. It is hard to read (flow is backwards) and misuses React's setState's API. I only did this to avoid having a function body, which is totally irrelevant... just for fun!**


after the ```=>``` for one statement, we will have access to ```hasAce``` and ```total```

```hasAce``` is a boolean (!! is how to cast to boolean in javascript) which is true when we can ```.find``` a card in ```this.state.cards``` who has a field ```.rank``` which equals 1 (ie is an ace)

```total``` is the sum of the cards, counting all face cards as 10, and aces as 1 (we'll manage the 'ace can be 11' rule in the body-statement of this callback function)


### Finally: calculate our new handStatus

```js
      this.setState(({ cards })=> ({
         handStatus: (total > 21) ? 'bust' :
                     (total >= 17) ? 'standing' :
                     (hasAce && (total === 11)) ? 'blackjack' :
                     (hasAce && (total >= 8) && (total < 11)) ? 'standing' :
                     'hitting'
       }) )
```

this statement is the body-statement of our callback function (fat arrow functions which are one line of code can be written without {curlies}!)

now that we know ```hasAce``` and ```total``` we can use our vast existing knowledge of the game of blackjack dealer rules to determine the next handStatus.

again we call ```this.setState``` with an updater function, destructuring ```cards``` from ```this.state```

we return (for setState to do a shallow merge onto state) an object with ```handStatus``` calculated with chained ternary expressions.


let's take a minute to learn about ternary by flipping a coin

```js
const condition = Math.random() > 0.5;

if( condition ) console.log('heads');
else console.log('tails');
```
can be refactored down to

```js
const condition = Math.random() > 0.5;
const output = condition ? 'heads' : 'tails';

console.log( output );
```

the value of the ternary is that we could rewrite this into one line, without using an ```if``` block

```js
console.log( Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails' );
```

because ternary is an **expression**... not a block statement!

as it turns out, each of the two outcomes are just expressions, so we can plug ternaries in there (chaining)

```js
const flip = ()=> (Math.random() > 0.5);

console.log( flip() ? 'heads first' :
             flip() ? 'heads second' :
                      'two tails' );
```

some people don't like doing this, even writing lint rules against it. I liked it for the handStatus example because it reads like proper functional pattern matching.


So that's all there is to it!, we check each possible outcome, and the first one to match (true) determines our handStatus value.


After the state has been updated, our render function is triggered, and the new card(s) and status are displayed to the user.

**This is just a silly example meant to prime you for the rest of the course. Don't worry if the code made not much sense yet!**

I'll leave it as an exercise for you to write this function HOW you're comfortable, when you're ready.

It's important here to find your own way in JavaScript - there's no other way to be found.

think it through:

 - play against dealer
 - keep track of bets
 - splitting, doubling down
 - insurance
 - multiplayer, online, ..!
