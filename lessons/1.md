Lesson 1

the actual first lesson - JSX


```
cd ~/code/react-course
git clone https://github.com/nikfrank/react-course-workbook-1
cd react-course-workbook-1
yarn
npm start
```

This is a silly little exercise to get us comfortable with React.Component's render function, and the JSX syntax they invented for it.

core concepts:

### state

this.state is where we put all the variables we want scoped to our component

we declare an initial state like

```js
class App extends Component {
  state = { someWord: 'balaganoosh' }

  //...
}
```

can read it out like

```js
class App extends Component {
  state = { someWord: 'balaganoosh' }

  render(){
    const { someWord } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>{someWord}</div>
    );
  }
}
```

(without destructuring we could've said ```const someWord = this.state.someWord;```)

React only wants us to [make changes to state using](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html) his ```this.setState``` function, which we used in workbook 0 and will talk about later; the important thing to know here is that any variables in our component that we ever want to change we should put into state.



### render

render is where we generate our JSX (fancy javascriptish HTML) when react is updating the view.

All we're doing in this example is reading a value from ```this.state```, then rendering it into a div. The curlies inside the ```<div>{someWord}</div>``` are called 'breakouts' - they allow us to break out of the HTML syntax and run any javascript. Whatever the expression in the breakout evaluates to will be rendered in place (here the string 'balaganoosh').

ok, the actual lesson:


First let's do a read through the App Component

here in our initial state, we have a list of Hebrew phrases I don't understand which we want to display to the user.

in our render, we read the words out of ```this.state```

then we're returning a div called 'App'

with create-react-app's default header

and a div called 'list-of-words' who has a breakout

the breakout maps each word to a JSX tag <p> withe word as its content

words.map returns a new array with our p tags, so react will end up with

```html
<div className='list-of-words'>
  <p>some word</p>
  <p>the next one</p>
  ...
</div>
```

which is how we end up with a list of words in our page!


### CSS

notice that the property ```className``` is what is linking us to our css (./src/App.css)

other than that, the CSS class usage is the same

later we'll cover React's style prop, where we can use [CSS-in-JSON](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style)

We aren't going to change anything about the map just yet, just work withe JSX and CSS


exercises:

1. replace the ```<div>``` with a ```<ul>``` and the ```<p>```s with ```<li>```s. Style it up a bit
2. replace everything with ```<div>```s and style using [flex-box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
3. put an x button on each item and remove that item onClick (if you can do this already, you're sandbagging!)
