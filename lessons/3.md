I've built here for you a tabs behaviour to start with - nothing special

we're going to fill in the tabs (a details form, a shopping list, and an invites list)

then we're going to split each tab into a Component, and use props to send data to the component and function calls back up

this is going to be our first refactor!

## core concepts:

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

imagine we have

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class TwoCounters extends Component {
  state = { count0: 0, count1: 0 }

  incCounter = counterName=> ()=>
    this.setState({ [counterName]: this.state[counterName] + 1 })

  reset = counterName=> ()=> this.setState({ [counterName]: 0 })

  render(){
    const { count0, count1 } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <div className='counter'>
          <span>{count0}</span>
          <button onClick={this.incCounter('count0')}>++</button>
          <button onClick={this.reset('count0')}>reset</button>
        </div>
        <div className='counter'>
          <span>{count1}</span>
          <button onClick={this.incCounter('count1')}>++</button>
          <button onClick={this.reset('count1')}>reset</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

(you can copy paste this into your app if you want to see it running)

You might notice that we're repeating ourself in our render

we have the same ```div.counter``` twice! just the value of the ```counterName``` we pass to our [curried](https://blog.benestudio.co/currying-in-javascript-es6-540d2ad09400) event handlers is different.

so what you should be asking is: Why Everything Twice? (WET being the opposite of DRY)


so for many reasons (code maintainability, laziness, ...) we want to write this Counter once and use it twice (or three hundred times even)

that way if we make any updates to the Counter, it will be reflected everywhere!

the while point of React's Component is to make it easy to do something like this.

What we'll do is make a Counter Component, which will need props: ```count``` for its current value, and an ```onChange``` function prop to call when we want to change it

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Counter extends Component {
  render(){
    const { count, onChange } = this.props;

    return (
      <div className='counter'>
        <span>{count}</span>
        <button onClick={()=> onChange(count+1)}>++</button>
        <button onClick={()=> onChange(0)}>reset</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class TwoCounters extends Component {
  state = { count0: 0, count1: 0 }

  change = counterName=> value=> this.setState({ [counterName]: value })

  render(){
    const { count0, count1 } = this.state;
    
    return (
      <div>
        <Counter count={count0} onChange={this.change('count0')} />
        <Counter count={count1} onChange={this.change('count1')} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

so now it's a lot easier to do new things!

let's say we want a double button

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Counter extends Component {
  render(){
    const { count, onChange } = this.props;

    return (
      <div className='counter'>
        <span>{count}</span>
        <button onClick={()=> onChange(count+1)}>++</button>
        <button onClick={()=> onChange(0)}>reset</button>
        <button onClick={()=> onChange(count*2)}>double</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

that was easy!

so that's the basics of props & Components, using them to dry out [refactor] our code.

now the actual lesson

(( if you want to write the tabs as an exercise, ```git checkout start```... that's not the main lesson here so we'll start with step0 ))


### getting started

```git checkout step0```


let's write our first tab


##### promo details

promo details is a form that updates a few values in the state

```js
//...

state = {
  name: '',
  imgSrc: '',
  eventType: '',
}

//...

setName = ({ target: { value } })=> this.setState({ name: value })
setImgSrc = ({ target: { value } })=> this.setState({ imgSrc: value })
setEventType = ({ target: { value } })=> this.setState({ eventType: value })

//...

render(){
  return (
  //...
    <div className='promo-tab'>
      <label htmlFor='name'>Name</label>
      <input id='name' value={name} onChange={this.setName}/>

      <label htmlFor='imgSrc'>Picture url</label>
      <input id='imgSrc' value={imgSrc} onChange={this.setImgSrc}/>

      <label htmlFor='eventType'>Event Type</label>
      <input id='eventType' value={eventType} onChange={this.setEventType}/>      
    </div>
  //...
  );
}
```

same as last time, pretty easy!




### step 1 the shopping list

```
git status # we should have work from start
git commit -am "all that work from step0"
git checkout step1

# if we want to keep all that work from step0
git merge step0
```





### step 2 the invitation list

```
git status # we should have work from start
git commit -am "all that work from step1"
git checkout step2

# if we want to keep all that work from step1
git merge step1
```

this is actually a simpler version of our shopping list
