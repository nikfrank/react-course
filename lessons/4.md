network behaviour: magic internet money exchange and the what if machine

```
cd ~/code/react-course
git clone https://github.com/nikfrank/react-course-workbook-4
cd react-course-workbook-4
yarn
npm start
```

this is going to be our first API call!


## core concepts:

### Promises (asynchronous code)

imagine we have an api we can call for a json of { [coinName]: exchangeRateNumber,.. }

we can load from that API as a response to a user click with:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class NetworkView extends Component {
  loadExchangeRates = ()=> fetch('https://some.api/for/rates')
                            .then(response => response.json())
                            .then(rates => this.setState({ rates }) )

  render(){
    const { rates={} } = this.state;
    
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.loadExchangeRates}>Reload</button>
        <ul>
          {
            Object.keys(rates).map(toCoin => (
              <li key={toCoin}>{toCoin} - {rates[toCoin]}</li>
            ) )
          }
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

export default NetworkView;
```

the steps of this app runtime are as follows:

- component is rendered by someone else (not shown here!)
- state is initially empty, so all that is rendered is a button and an empty ul
- component sits alone and sad, waiting for user input
- user clicks the button, running the this.loadExchangeRates function
- the function is called with a React-Synthetic event, which is ignored
- that function uses the browser's fetch api to make an http request
- fetch returns a Promise, which is an object representing a future value
- that future value here will be the response of the http call
- each .then chains on a function to run once the previous Promise / then resolves
- the return value (a Promise) of the loadExchangeRates function is ignored
- eventually the http call resolves a response object (google 'browser fetch mdn')
- the Promise then triggers the first .then function, which parses the response as json
- reponse.json() is actually returning a Promise, which the next .then waits for resolving
- the second .then is triggered withe data resolved from the http call json parse
- that function calls this.setState to save the data to the Component's state
- state eventually changes, and once it does -> React reconciler triggers a render
- now ```rates``` is an object, so Object.keys gives us a list of strings (coinNames here)
- we render the button and a ```<ul>``` with ```<li>```s each displaying an exchange rate 

Using Promise's .then and .catch (for errors) will be very useful in writing our network layer, or when we're writing on the server.

Once you're used to it, most of the work of writing a network layer is designing the API - not so much work to call it. Designing an API is a task usually done alongside a server team, as efficiencies and obstacles can be found by thinking through the entire data flow of an application in advance of writing it. API design is another topic for another day though... we'll be using someone else's API here!

[MDN has a pretty good explanation here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)

I also recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ) about the js async model


It usually takes a while to get used to js's async / sync code abstraction - it can be useful to play around with setTimeout and console.log until you're comfortable with which code will run when.

now the actual lesson


### getting started with fetch

```git checkout step0```

review connectHOC

here, we'll write the api call, hardcode -> render

then we'll attach the controlled inputs to the api call



##### calling cryptocompare

```js
//...


```




### step 0 testing

```
git status # we should have work from step0
git commit -am "all that work from step0"
git checkout step0-testing

# if we want to keep all that work from step0
git merge step0
```

explain the runtime for browser vs jsdom w enzyme

fake the api

test calling the api

test the raw component (pass hooks spies)

discuss coverage




### step 1, historical results, accumulate results

```
git status # we should have work from step0-testing
git commit -am "all that work from step0-testing"
git checkout step1

# if we want to keep all that work from step0-testing
git merge step0-testing
```

put in a DatePicker

call the API for historical data

append result to list

componentWillReceiveProps (dep... what is new api?) -> reduce totals

render table w totals

( TDD the reducer! )

error handling on the api call -> toastr for ERRnoSuchCoin



### step 2, localStorage save load clear

```
git status # we should have work from step1
git commit -am "all that work from step1"
git checkout step2

# if we want to keep all that work from step1
git merge step1
```

side menu with buttons

hooks for SLC (discuss why these are hooks)

testing with fake localStorage



### step 3, omg look at this chart

```
git status # we should have work from step2
git commit -am "all that work from step2"
git checkout step3

# if we want to keep all that work from step2
git merge step3
```

recharts npm, decide / design chart output

compute data TDD for chart (mock data, test, render)

style for mobile



### step 4, mobile deploy

```
git status # we should have work from step3
git commit -am "all that work from step3"
git checkout step4

# if we want to keep all that work from step3
git merge step4
```

css layouts concept -> css grid

implement for mobile and desktop, discuss testing tools in chrome

deploy to heroku


!!! now go interview for junior react jobs !!!
