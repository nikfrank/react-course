# Lesson 4 (v2)

### network behaviour: magic internet money exchange and the what if machine

[workbook 4v2 - btc what-if machine](https://github.com/nikfrank/react-course-workbook-4-v2)

Agenda:

- concepts: Promise (asynchronous code) for API calls
- step 1: exchange rates chart from API
  - i  : query builder Component (pick coins, range)
  - ii : call the cryptocompare histoday api
  - iii: route response json to chart (recharts Line)
- step 2: refactor entire app for multi-chart mode
- step 3: using chart response data also for calculating "what if" trades
- bonus
  - multiple "from" currencies on one chart
  - panning the chart back / forth in time



## core concepts:

### Promises (asynchronous code)

imagine we have an api we can call like
```js
fetch('https://some.api/rates/buying/USD')
```

for a response json like:
```js
{
  BTC: 7104.4,
  ETH: 480.5,
  WINGS: 0.48
}
```
which we will use to calculate exchanges from (BTC / ETH / WINGS) to USD


we can load from that API as a response to a user click with:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Exchanger extends Component {
  loadExchangeRates = ()=> fetch('https://some.api/for/rates')
                            .then(response => response.json())
                            .then(rates => this.setState({ rates }) )

  render(){
    const { rates={} } = this.state;
    
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.loadExchangeRates}>Reload</button>
        <ul>
          {
            Object.keys(rates).map(toCoin => (
              <li key={toCoin}>{toCoin} - {rates[toCoin]}</li>
            ) )
          }
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

export default NetworkView;
```

the steps of this app runtime are as follows:

- component is rendered by someone else (not shown here! maybe ./src/App.js)
- state is initially empty {} POJO by default
 - ```const { rates={} } = this.state;``` will use the default value {} for rates
 - ```Object.keys(rates)``` will be an [] empty array ({} has no keys!)
 - so all that is rendered is a button and an empty ul
- Exchanger Component sits alone and sad, waiting for user input
- user clicks the button, running the this.loadExchangeRates function
 - the function is called with a React-Synthetic event, which is ignored
 - that function uses the browser's fetch api to make an http request
  - fetch returns a Promise, which is an object representing a future value
  - that future value here will be the response of the http call
  - each .then chains on a function to run once the previous Promise / then resolves
  - the return value (a Promise) of the loadExchangeRates function is ignored
 - eventually the http call resolves a response object (google 'browser fetch mdn')
  - the Promise then triggers the first .then function, which parses the response as json
   - reponse.json() is actually returning a Promise, which the next .then waits for resolving
  - the second .then is triggered withe data resolved from the http call json parse
   - that function calls this.setState to save the data to the Component's state
- state eventually changes, and once it does -> React reconciler triggers a render
- now ```this.state.rates``` is an object, so Object.keys gives us a list of strings (coinNames here)
- we render the button and a ```<ul>``` with ```<li>```s each displaying an exchange rate 

Using Promise's .then and .catch (for errors) will be very useful in writing our network layer, or when we're writing on the server.

Once you're used to it, most of the work of writing a network layer is designing the API - not so much work to call it. Designing an API is a task usually done alongside a server team, as efficiencies and obstacles can be found by thinking through the entire data flow of an application in advance of writing it. API design is another topic for another day though... we'll be using someone else's API here!

[MDN has a pretty good explanation here for Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)

if you want to try them out [MDN has a playground here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then)

I also recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ) about the js async model


It usually takes a while to get used to js's async / sync code abstraction - it can be useful to play around with setTimeout and console.log until you're comfortable with which code will run when.

now the actual lesson





## step 1 minimum viable app
### step 1 i - make a component to pick currencies


```git checkout step1```


```touch src/CoinPicker.js```

let's write some React boilerplate for this Component

./src/CoinPicker.js
```js
import React from 'react';

export default (props)=> (
  <div>
    Coming soon...
  </div>
);
```

and we will render one into our App

./src/App.js
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';

import CoinPicker from './CoinPicker';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <CoinPicker/>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```


We'll want two dropdown ```<select>``` tags to choose our ```from``` and ```to``` currencies


first, create a state for our App and set two default coins

./src/App.js
```js
//...

class App extends Component {
  state = {
    fromCoin: 'WINGS',
    toCoin: 'USD',
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <CoinPicker fromCoin={this.state.fromCoin} toCoin={this.state.toCoin}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

//...
```

here we're passing the values to our CoinPicker via props, so it can display the current selection

[read more about React function as Component and Props here](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

We're also using [parameter destructuring... here's a link to MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)


./src/CoinPicker.js
```js
export default ({ fromCoin, toCoin, setFrom, setTo })=> (
  <div className='CoinPicker'>
    <label>
      From
      <select value={fromCoin} onChange={setFrom}>
        <option value=''>Select From Coin</option>
        <option value='USD'>USD</option>
        <option value='EUR'>EUR</option>
        <option value='BTC'>BTC</option>
        <option value='ETH'>ETH</option>
        <option value='WINGS'>WINGS</option>
      </select>
    </label>

    <label>
      To
      <select value={toCoin} onChange={setTo}>
        <option value=''>Select To Coin</option>
        <option value='USD'>USD</option>
        <option value='EUR'>EUR</option>
        <option value='BTC'>BTC</option>
        <option value='ETH'>ETH</option>
        <option value='WINGS'>WINGS</option>
      </select>
    </label>
  </div>
);
```

Here we are using React's controlled input pattern [read more in their docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

We now need to make our onChange handlers (setFrom and setTo) to make our ```<select>```s work


./src/App.js
```js
//...
  setFrom = event=> this.setState({ fromCoin: event.target.value })
  setTo = event=> this.setState({ toCoin: event.target.value })
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <CoinPicker fromCoin={this.state.fromCoin}
                    toCoin={this.state.toCoin}
                    setFrom={this.setFrom}
                    setTo={this.setTo}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
//...
```

now our ```<select>```s will trigger state updates from CoinPicker into App when on user change events!

[read here about React's this.setState](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

We're following React's "lifting state" pattern which helps keep our logic organized... [read more here](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)

This pattern should be familiar to you if you've gone through workbook-2 (work for snoop)



let's finish up by making a css file for our CoinPicker and adding a bit of style

```touch src/CoinPicker.css```


./src/CoinPicker.js
```js
import React from 'react';
import './CoinPicker.css';

//...
```

./src/CoinPicker.css
```css
.CoinPicker {
  padding: 4px;
}

.CoinPicker label {
  margin: 4px;
}

.CoinPicker select {
  margin-left: 8px;
  min-width: 150px;
}
```

That'll have to do for now. Nothing fancy!


We're done the first step - we can pick our currencies. Next is to gather data from an API





### step 1 ii - gather data from an API

to jump here use

```git checkout step1-ii```

Whenever a user selects a new coin, we want to call an API to get historical conversion rates to display


When we get the data back from the api, we'll save it to our ```state```, so in step 1 iii we can pass it to a chart!



we'll use React's ```componentDidUpdate``` lifecycle method to trigger the call [read more here](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidupdate)


React will call this function whenever our state changes, so we'll want to make sure we can make a new request before bothering to call


./src/App.js
```js
//...
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState){
    if( this.state.toCoin && this.state.fromCoin &&
        ( (this.state.fromCoin !== prevState.fromCoin ) ||
          (this.state.toCoin !== prevState.toCoin ) ) ) {

      console.log('call api', this.state.fromCoin, this.state.toCoin);
    }
  }
//...
```

if that boolean statement looks weird to you read about [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) and [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy)

(we can check the console in our browser now to see when this is triggered)


we'll be using [cryptocompare's histoday api](https://www.cryptocompare.com/api/#-api-data-histoday-) for data

and the browser ```fetch``` for our http call [read about fetch here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)


```fetch``` uses ```Promise```s, which is why we covered them in the theory section!


Now let's fill in our API call!

./src/App.js
//...
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState){
    if( this.state.toCoin && this.state.fromCoin &&
        ( (this.state.fromCoin !== prevState.fromCoin ) ||
          (this.state.toCoin !== prevState.toCoin ) ) ) {

      fetch(`https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/histoday?`+
            `fsym=${this.state.fromCoin}&tsym=${this.state.toCoin}&limit=60&aggregate=3&e=CCCAGG`)
        .then( response => response.json() )
        .then( responseJson => {
          console.log(responseJson);
        });
    }
  }
//...
```

To make our request url we're using string template literals [read more here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)


We wait for the response,
 - *then* we parse the response as json
 - *then* we receive the responseJson and can do whatever we want with it (for now, just logging)

Try running this in the browser (set values for your currencies) and you'll see the responseJson logged to the console

we can see that the conversaion rate we want is in an array called ```.Data``` (not too expressive a name... SAD!)

each item in the array has a ```.time``` (which is in [unix epoch seconds](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now)) and a few different rates from the course of a given day (open, close, high)


We'll be rendering this data into a chart in the next step. For now let's just save what we want to our ```.state```

.src/App.js
```js
//...

state = {
    fromCoin: '',
    toCoin: '',
    historicalRates: [],
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState){
    if( this.state.toCoin && this.state.fromCoin &&
        ( (this.state.fromCoin !== prevState.fromCoin ) ||
          (this.state.toCoin !== prevState.toCoin ) ) ) {

      fetch(`https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/histoday?`+
            `fsym=${this.state.fromCoin}&tsym=${this.state.toCoin}&limit=60&aggregate=3&e=CCCAGG`)
        .then( response => response.json() )
        .then( responseJson => {
          this.setState({ historicalRates: responseJson.Data });
        });
    }
  }
  
//...
```

good job! now we're ready for the last step in our minimum viable chart


### step 1 iii - making a chart

to jump here use

```git checkout step1-iii```


React has a wonderful ecosystem, with many packages ready to solve mot of our problems!

Let's add [recharts](https://npmjs.org/package/recharts) to display our exchange rate data we now have.


Recharts has examples available [here](http://recharts.org/en-US/examples)

specifically we'll be working from [this example](https://jsfiddle.net/alidingling/xqjtetw0/)


To add a package to our project, from the command line (in our project root)

```yarn add recharts```


now we'll want to make another Component for our chart rendering logic

```touch src/RatesChart.js```

./src/RatesChart.js
```js
import React from 'react';
import { LineChart, Line, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend } from 'recharts';


export default ({ rates })=> (
  <div>
    Coming soon...
  </div>
);
```

with a placeholder for now.

Let's render our placeholder in our App and fill in it as we go

./src/App.js
```js
//...

import CoinPicker from './CoinPicker';
import RatesChart from './RatesChart';

//...

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <CoinPicker fromCoin={this.state.fromCoin}
                    toCoin={this.state.toCoin}
                    setFrom={this.setFrom}
                    setTo={this.setTo}/>
        <RatesChart />
      </div>
    );
  }
//...
```

so now we're ready to pass data to our RatesChart component, so we can use a recharts LineChart there.

In Step 1 ii, we saved our exchange rate data in ```this.state.historicalRates``` once we got it from the API

so let's pass it into our component by a prop called ```rates```

./src/App.js
```js
//...

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <CoinPicker fromCoin={this.state.fromCoin}
                    toCoin={this.state.toCoin}
                    setFrom={this.setFrom}
                    setTo={this.setTo}/>
        
        <RatesChart rates={this.state.historicalRates}/>
      </div>
    );
  }

//...
```

and now in RatesChart we'll receive ```rates``` whenever it is updated.

Let's try rendering out a LineChart based on the example

./src/RatesChart.js
```js
import React from 'react';
import { LineChart, Line, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend } from 'recharts';

export default ({ rates })=> (
  <LineChart width={600} height={300} data={rates}
             margin={{top: 5, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 5}}>
    <XAxis dataKey='time'/>
    <YAxis/>
    <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray='3 3'/>
    <Tooltip/>
    <Legend />
    <Line type='monotone' dataKey='open' stroke='#8884d8' activeDot={{r: 8}}/>
    <Line type='monotone' dataKey='high' stroke='#82ca9d' />
  </LineChart>
);
```

That worked pretty well!

Notice that the LineChart uses our ```rates``` prop as our data source

The ```<XAxis>``` uses ```time``` from our data for our x coordinate

and each ```<Line>``` reads a different dataKey to make a line


The only thing that's weird is that our x-axis is displaying Unix epoch times (which users won't understand... I've tried)

let's look up in the [recharts XAxis component's API](http://recharts.org/en-US/api/XAxis) to find out how format our tick strings


...


if you found ```tickFormatter```, that looks good (there isn't much documentation, but we should be able to guess how it works)

let's guess based on its name that it gives us our XAxis value as an argument (currently an epoch seconds value) and will render whatever we return from the function we make


so using javascript's built in [Date class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) and [Date formatter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString)

./src/RatesChart.js
```js
//...
// convert seconds to milliseconds by * 1000
const dayFromEpochSeconds = epochSeconds =>
  (new Date(epochSeconds * 1000)).toLocaleDateString('en-US');


//...
    <XAxis dataKey='time' tickFormatter={dayFromEpochSeconds}/>
//...

```

now our chart is beautiful.


One last thing before we move on - let's not show an empty chart when we load the page

[Conditional rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html#inline-if-else-with-conditional-operator) is pretty straightforward in React, so let's give it a try

we'll want to only render the RatesChart once ```this.state.historicalRates``` has values in it


./src/App.js
```js
//...
        { this.state.historicalRates.length ? (
            <RatesChart rates={this.state.historicalRates}/>
        ) : null }
//...
```

very nice!

Now go and be creative! Make a dropdown for selecting the timespan on the chart (currently our API call asks for 60 days of data).. or whatever you want (the Legend still renders the epoch seconds... see if you can figure out how to fix that!)



## step 2 - multi chart

to jump here

```git checkout step2```


Our little app is wonderful, but this coin-rates-chart combo is less of an app and more of a Component

In this step we'll refactor all of our work into a reusable Component, then we'll build a +/- feature so we can create and destroy charts in our view.
