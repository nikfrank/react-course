### concepts:

Here we're going to do a bunch of super useful examples of getting data from users!

But to jazz it up, we're making an application form for a job in [tha dogg pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tha_Dogg_Pound)


#### state, onChange

every time the user types even one character, we want that in the state

(the react way to think is "I want to render anything the user inputs, to render anything it must be in the state, so every time the user types we update the state")

```js
class App extends Component {
  state = { someWord: '' }

  render(){
    const { someWord } = this.state;
    
    return (
      <input value={someWord} />
    );
  }
}
```

so we're going to use react's input onChange callback prop to make a "controlled input"

```js
class App extends Component {
  state = { someWord: '' }

  wordChanged = ()=> { /* special sauce */ }

  render(){
    const { someWord } = this.state;
    
    return (
      <input value={someWord} onChange={this.wordChanged} />
    );
  }
}
```


React only wants us to [make changes to state using](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html) his ```this.setState``` function, so that's what we'll need to use in ```this.wordChanged``` to update on every text input change.


```js
class App extends Component {
  state = { someWord: '' }

  wordChanged = ({ target: { value } })=> this.setState({ someWord: value })

  render(){
    const { someWord } = this.state;
    
    return (
      <input value={someWord} onChange={this.wordChanged} />
    );
  }
}
```

This solution maybe is a bit confusing right now, so let's break it down:

[react inputs onChange sends us a synthetic event object](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) - the only value from which we care about is the new value of the input box.

So if we had written

```js
wordChanged = event => this.setState({ someWord: event.target.value })
```

we would also be correct (here I'm using [parameter destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Object_destructuring) from es6, same as in ```const { someWord } = this.state```)

Since we're only using one value from the entire synthetic event, it's more legible to destructure it and avoid naming a variable we'll never use (```event```)

(( in case you're wondering ```.target``` is a reference to the react-dom virtual element targeted by the ```change``` event, ```.value``` is therefore the value we want to read from the input! ))


We'll use this same pattern for inputs of all sorts.

ok, the actual lesson:

### getting started step: clicking a button

```$ git checkout start```

here we're going to put an initial state and bind our submit button's onClick to a function that logs out the state (later we could use that function to send data to a server)

#### initial state

we already have an inital state, it's just empty!

```js
class App extends Component {
  state = {}

  //...
}
```

so let's put in some initial values for the ```.rapName``` and ```.albumSales``` we'll be inputting

```js
class App extends Component {
  state = {
    rapName: '',
    albumSales: 0,
  }

  //...
}
```

in react we render values from state into JSX

which is to say, our values should render into our inputs

```html
<input id='rap-name' placeholder='Rap Name'/>
```

let's give our input a value prop (to **control** the value)


```html
<input id='rap-name' placeholder='Rap Name' value={this.state.rapName}/>
```

now we can test this by setting an initial state value other than ''

( taking user input is in the next step )

it is left to the reader to implement this for the albumSales input


#### onClick submit

Let's say we have the values we want in our form, and the user wants to submit the form

we'll need to make an instance method for the submit button to call

```html
<button>Submit</button>
```

we can write

```html
<button onClick={this.submitForm}>Submit</button>
```

and so we'll also need a submitForm function

```js
class App extends Component {
  state = {
    rapName: '',
    albumSales: 0,
  }

  submitForm = ()=> {
    console.log( this.state );
    // just log the overall state for now... we'll cover API calls later
  }
  
  //...
}
```

we can see the state of our form logged in the console (Ctrl Shift i / command option j) when we hit submit

next up, user input!


### step 0: user input from our input boxes

```
$ git status # we should have work from start
$ git commit -am "all that work from start"
$ git checkout step0

# if we want to keep all that work from start
$ git merge start
```

ok, now we want the user's input to be set in the state so it can be rendered back to the user (which is what they expect to happen!)

just like we saw in the conecpts section, we'll be adding onChange callback props to all of our inputs

```html
<input id='rap-name' placeholder='Rap Name' value={this.state.rapName}/>
```

we can write

```html
<input id='rap-name'
       placeholder='Rap Name'
       onChange={this.setRapName}
       value={this.state.rapName}/>
```

and so we'll need to write our ```setRapName``` instance method

```js
class App extends Component {
  state = {
    rapName: '',
    albumSales: 0,
  }

  submitForm = ()=> {
    console.log( this.state );
    // just log the overall state for now... we'll cover API calls later
  }
  
  //...
}
```

can become

```js
class App extends Component {
  state = {
    rapName: '',
    albumSales: 0,
  }

  setRapName = ({ target: { value } })=> this.setState({ rapName: value })

  submitForm = ()=> {
    console.log( this.state );
    // just log the overall state for now... we'll cover API calls later
  }
  
  //...
}
```

now when we hit submit, we should see the new value for ```.rapName``` logged as part of the state object

again, I'll leave it to the reader to implement the same thing for album sales



#### step 1: Dropdown selections

```
$ git status # we should have work from step 0
$ git commit -am "all that work from step 0"
$ git checkout step1

# if we want to keep all that work from step 0
$ git merge step0
```

Snoop is going to want to know more than a name and a number!

He also has a list of open positions to apply to, and is going to want to know where you're from (country / state)

first let's add a field to our init state

```js
//...
state = {
  rapName: '',
  albumSales: 0,
  applyingFor: '',
}
//...
```

and a [select tag](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#the-select-tag) with our options

```js
//...
<div className='form-field'>
  <select>
    <option value=''>Select Position</option>
    <option value='driver'>Driver</option>
    <option value='trafficker'>Trafficker</option>
    <option value='producer'>Producer</option>
    <option value='rapper'>Rapper</option>
  </select>
</div>
//...
```

now all we need is an onChange and value prop just like our last examples! (left as an exercise)

( see if you can use [the programmer's secret weapon](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/72ywm5/just_got_my_new_stackoverflow_keyboard/) to complete most of this exercise )


#### Conditional Rendering

Sometimes we want to only render an element for certain states

Here, only when ```country === 'USA'``` are we going to want a ```<select/>``` for State

(( I'll capitalize State when referring to State from United States, state still means our component's ```this.state```  ... sorry for the confusion ))

( later, we could choose the options for State based on the country, this is the simpler exercise to start with )

Using [react's docs for conditional rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html#inline-if-with-logical--operator) we see it's pretty easy to render our State select based on our ```this.state.country```

```js
{
  (this.state.country === 'USA') ? (
    <div className='form-field'>
      <select value={this.state.whichState}
              onChange={this.setWhichState}>
        <option value=''>Select State</option>
        <option value='CA'>California</option>
        <option value='NY'>New York</option>
        <option value='MI'>Michigan</option>
      </select>
    </div>
  ) : null
}
```

here we're using our great friend the ternary expression:
- when country is USA, the expression evaluates to a select tag
- otherwise, the expression evaluates to ```null```, which in JSX means "render nothing"

again, we have a naming issue with "State", so I've named the field 'whichState' to avoid overloading ```this.setState``` lol. Perhaps this is why Canada calls them "provinces"


for the step2 solution I've also styled the select boxes (which were pretty ugly by default)


#### step 2: Validation

```
$ git status # we should have work from step 1
$ git commit -am "all that work from step 1"
$ git checkout step2

# if we want to keep all that work from step 1
$ git merge step1
```

Snoop wants us to validate our input!

Rap Names **must** contain "gg"

also, Snoop wants applicants to provide a valid email address.

What we need to do is every time the value changes, we'll set the value AND calculate another value for the state like ```isRapNameValid```, which we'll use to conditionally render a validation message to the user:


```js
  setRapName = ({ target: { value } })=>
    this.setState({
      rapName: value,
      isRapNameValid: value.includes('gg') && (value.length > 2),
    })
```

and in our render function (perhaps right after the input box)


```js
{
  (!this.state.isRapNameValid && (this.state.rapName.length > 2)) ? (
    <div className='invalid-field-warning'>
      Rap Name must contain "gg"
    </div>
  ) : null
}
```

the entire flow for the email field will be left to the reader

checking that an email is valid is best done with a [regex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)

[here's a standard email regex](http://emailregex.com/)


in the solution for the step (```git checkout step3```) I've also added styling for the invalid-field-warning className, so it will look like a problem (red)



Snoop wants our submit to be disabled when there is invalid data in our state

```html
<button onClick={this.submitForm}
        disabled={!this.state.isEmailValid ||
                  !this.state.isRapNameValid ||
                  !this.state.applyingFor ||
                  !this.state.country ||
                  (this.state.country ==='USA' && !this.state.whichState)}>
  Submit
</button>
```

not too shabby! We're checking that the form is filled AND the fields with validation have passed.



### step 3: Date inputs

```
$ git status # we should have work from step 2
$ git commit -am "all that work from step 2"
$ git checkout step3

# if we want to keep all that work from step 2
$ git merge step2
```

Lastly, Snoop wants to know when you can start working!

To make our life easy, we're not going to build a datepicker from scratch - that'd be reinventing the wheel!

Instead, we're going to use [Hacker0x01's popular react-datepicker module](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker)

```$ yarn add react-datepicker moment```

the react-datepicker docs should give you all you need to pick a date and put it in the state!
